# Week 1

This repository contains the initial setup for analyzing greenhouse gas emissions using supply chain emission factors for U.S. industries and commodities.

## âœ… Tasks Completed
- Downloaded dataset from GitHub:  
  [`SupplyChainEmissionFactorsforUSIndustriesCommodities.xlsx`](https://github.com/Anmol200312/Greenhouse-emissions-/blob/main/SupplyChainEmissionFactorsforUSIndustriesCommodities.xlsx)
- Added a code cell in the Jupyter Notebook to automatically download the dataset.
- Set up the environment for data analysis and model development.

## ðŸ“„ File Included
- `GHG_Emissions_Prediction_UPDATED_with_download.ipynb`: Notebook with the dataset download and initial setup.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To prepare data for building a predictive model of greenhouse gas emissions based on supply chain factors.
